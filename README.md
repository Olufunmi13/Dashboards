IT Survey Analysis In Power BI

Introduction

This dataset contains IT Job survey for Germany in 2018. The analysis is aimed at visualising the job positions and their salaries for an easy peep into the positions for salary expectations. The dataset contains 959 rows and 12 columns.

Data Cleaning

This entire analysis was carried out using Power BI. The dataset does not contain nulls or empty rows, the rows and columns were formatted correctly. The major cleaning that was done was the addition of a conditional column in the power query editor for easy data understanding.

We created a calculations table to keep our calculated measures, measures are effective to enhance calculations without creating new columns. we created a measure for total survey participants and average salary.

Now, our data is ready for visualization.

Letâ€™s visualise the participants by gender, remember that this visualise is aimed at having an overview of the salary range in the IT industry from the provided data.

Software engineers get the most pay of all the job roles, and machine learning engineers get the least pay, of all the job roles, participants with the senior role often got the most pay and those with the head position get the least pay.

Mega-sized companies (1000+) employees pay the most, from the chart, we can conclude that salary varies between companies depending on their sizes.

Conclusion

We can therefore conclude that mega-sized companies pay the most of which software engineers get the highest quota to unlimited contract employees, and it's amazing to note that most employees communicate in English.
